# cs410-bullying

To get this running locally, you will need to add an entry into your /etc/hosts file like so:

127.0.0.1    cs-410-project.com

This is due to Facebook's API requiring a URL source in order to use the API. I have temporarily
set it to cs-410-project.com but will add the real domain at a later point in time!

To access the site, you will need to start a simple HTTP server with the document root pointed
at the root of the project directory. Open your browser and go to cs-410-project.com and the
site should show up for you.
