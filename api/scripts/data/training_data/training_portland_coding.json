The idea is to make smaller, affordable improvements in existing parks and facilities which can make a big, immediate and tangible difference to a community without waiting for a bond measure (which could take years).\r\n\r\nPortland Parks & Recreation staff are working on amenities such as benches, painting play structures and both refurbishing and installing new play equipment, new water fountains, and benches. \r\n\r\nThe E-205 Initiative came about under the guidance of City Parks Commissioner Nick Fish. New parks can cost in the tens of millions and Portland Parks & Recreation is looking toward a bond measure in the future to address these service gaps. However, as mentioned, a bond measure will take years. Fortunately, PP&R is able to make noticeable, tangible, and useable improvements at this time and going forward.\r\n\r\n\u201cMany Portlanders love our city for its beautiful parks, but few people recognize how many citizens don\u2019t have access to them,\u201d says Nick Hardigg, Executive Director of the Portland Parks Foundation. \r\n\u201cThat is especially true in East Portland, where the population has been rising for decades with very few parks being created. We see the projects of E-205 as both extremely necessary and also having a remarkable return on investment. Nowhere can so little money have a greater impact than with E-205. As the fundraising foundation for Portland\u2019s park-loving citizens, equity of access is central to our mission. We are an eager partner to make these outstanding opportunities become reality.\u201d\r\nwww.portlandparksfoundation.org"},{"code": "Community Event", "post": "SuperPalooza at Sellwood Park, SE 7th & Miller.\nSunday, July 22 beginning at 1:00pm.

He received his B.S. from Gonzaga University in Education, Sociology, and Philosophy. In 2001, he was awarded an honorary Doctorate of Law degree by the University of Vermont.\r\n\r\nJordan spent 10 years as Portland\u2019s first African-American City Commissioner beginning in 1974. He then served 14 years as Director of Portland Parks & Recreation, retiring in 2003. Jordan literally changed Portland\u2019s landscape by overseeing 44 new parks and natural areas during his tenure.\r\n\r\nJordan was the force behind Portland landmarks such as Pioneer Courthouse Square, the Interstate Firehouse Cultural Center, Delta Park, Southwest Community Center, renovations to Tom McCall Waterfront Park and Matt Dishman Community Center, and many more public projects and successes.  \r\n\r\nAs City Commissioner, Charles Jordan was noted for his innovative and unconventional approaches to problem solving. He developed the Community Juvenile Officer Program that put Portland Police officers in local schools to engage youth through positive interaction and activities. As Fire Commissioner, he developed an outreach training program to recruit people of color to the Fire Bureau.  \r\n\r\nOn the national stage, Charles Jordan broadened the agenda of the environmental movement and land conservation to make it more inclusive. He is known for his groundbreaking approach to putting people \u2013 particularly people of color \u2013 at the heart of the American Conservation Movement.\r\n\r\n \u201cCharles is a spiritual person with a strong connection to his church, and he saw us all as being connected,\u201d says Michelle Harper, who worked with Jordan for years in several capacities. Portland\u2019s parks were where we could come together to build community and family.\u201d\r\n\r\nMore hallmarks of Jordan\u2019s tenure include popular PP&R programs such as Movies in the Park, as well as innumerable youth initiatives. Jordan gained public support for two large bond measures and a parks levy. Charles Jordan\u2019s leadership, commitment to Portland, and innovative policies have helped to ensure the city\u2019s high quality of life for generations to come."},{"code": "Community Event", "post": "Best of the City 2012 -- Arts & Entertainment Portland Parks & Recreation Celebrates Another E205 Initiative Success\n\nVentura Park Bicycle Pump Track Dedication with NW Trail Alliance\n\n\n(Portland, OR) \u2013\nPortland Parks & Recreation (PP&R) and the Northwest Trail Alliance (NWTA) will celebrate the Ventura Park bicycle pump track, an E205 Initiative project, on Monday, July 9 beginning at noon.\n\nWHAT: Ventura Park Bicycle Pump track Celebration\nWHEN: Monday, July 9 12pm-1pm\nWHERE: Ventura Park, SE 115th & Stark\n\nThe purpose of the event is to both celebrate the track and the sense of community it brings to historically underserved East Portland via the City\u2019s E205 Initiative. \n\nWhat is a pump track?\nA pump track is a continuous dirt loop that can be ridden on a bicycle without the need for pedaling. Pump tracks have banked turns and rolling hills to maintain momentum. \n\nThis pilot, or demonstration project, was built and is being maintained by the Northwest Trail Alliance (NWTA) under a formal agreement with Portland Parks & Recreation.\n \nThe site is being monitored carefully during the ongoing trial period. After a year of operations, PP&R will again work with the community and the neighborhood association to understand the benefits and challenges of this feature. After that assessment, we will determine whether or not a pump track is a good fit for this park. PP&R is looking for continued good stewardship and community support.\n\nThe track is not designed for skateboarders or BMX riders.\n\nThanks to Our Partners\nPP&R wishes to thank Tom Archer, Jon Pheanis, and the NW Trail Alliance for their efforts in building and maintaining this recreational feature, and to the International Mountain Biking Association (IMBA) for their support and design of the pump track.\nSpecial thanks to Arlene Kimura and Linda Robinson and the Hazelwood Neighborhood Association.\n\nA-Track-ting Attention\n\nSeveral PP&R sites made Portland Monthly\u2019s Best in Portland list \nhttp:\/\/www.portlandmonthlymag.com\/arts-and-entertainment\/articles\/best-of-the-city-may-2012\/\n\nIn the \"Best Diversions\" category, the Ventura Park pump track won the Best Park Addition!\nThe Ventura bike skill course, aka the Ventura Pump Track, is a project that\u2019s part of the E205 Initiative.\nThe site can be seen in this video on the PP&R website:\nhttp:\/\/www.portlandonline.com\/parks\/index.cfm?c=54677\n\nProject Background\nPortland Parks & Recreation is committed to providing high quality active and passive recreational activities for all Portlanders. East Portland lags far behind the rest of the city in parks amenities. The development of this pump track is an important step in addressing that deficiency.\nIn response to this need, PP&R began working with the Northwest Trail Alliance to create Portland's first bike skills course. Ventura Park was determined to be an appropriate location because of the large amount of land in the park, the proximity to Ventura Park School, and the willingness of the Hazelwood Neighborhood Association to support a temporary facility to test the need, community response, and impact of a bike skills course.\nProject Outreach\nWorking with the Hazelwood Neighborhood Association, PP&R developed a comprehensive outreach strategy that involved mailing more than 400 postcards, distributing more than 200 fliers door to door, electronic notifications, and sending more than 1,000 fliers home with students from Floyd Light Middle School and Ventura Park School. All materials were provided in English, Russian, and Spanish. The demonstration took place on a Saturday morning in April. More than 50 individuals participated in the event. Additionally, the comment form was available online for two weeks after the event. More than 80 individuals completed the comment form. After the event, an article on the project appeared in the East Portland Neighborhood News http:\/\/eastpdxnews.com\/general-news-features\/new-style-bicycle-track-comes-to-hazelwood-park\/\nPP&R heard significant support for the bike skills course during the outreach process. This support led to our decision to move forward with this pilot, or demonstration, project.\n\nAbout the E205 Initiative\nThe City of Portland has an unwavering commitment to areas east of I-205. 75% of Portlanders enjoy access to a park or natural area within a fifteen-minute walk of their home. Many of the parks provide a variety of amenities from sports fields and playgrounds to pathways and picnic areas. When looking at the park system east of I-205, we see a different picture. Incorporated later into the City of Portland, East Portland does not have the rich tradition of parks and recreational places. Yet, East Portland has experienced population growth and now 40% of families with children are living in this area. Demand for equitable recreational services is high. New parks can cost in the tens of millions and Portland Parks & Recreation is looking toward a bond measure in the future to address these service gaps.\nIn the meantime, the E205 Initiative is underway, improving and adding to the amenities in existing parks. Smaller, affordable basic improvements can make a big difference to a community without waiting for a bond measure. Designed to make minor improvements (under $250,000 per site) such as a community gardens, lighting or playgrounds, E205 will leverage City dollars with private dollars to complete projects in East Portland as an ongoing commitment to the area. The City Council has allocated $500,000 towards immediate improvements for existing East Portland parks; the Portland Parks Foundation is working with private individuals, businesses, and foundations to match the City's dedicated funding.\n\nBike Camp Too\n\nMonday, July 9 will also be the first day of the NWTA\u2019s Mountain Bike Skill Builder camp, held in collaboration with PP&R. \n\nThe camp spans four days and will feature both bike skills and environmental stewardship components. It is open to kids ages 10-14. Campers will visit Ventura, Powell Butte, Cascade Locks, and Sandy Ridge Trail systems. Partners are NWTA, Portland Parks & Recreation, the Portland Parks Foundation, Bike Gallery, and The Lumberyard Bike Park.\n  \nThe first day of camp (held during the pump track celebration) will involve instruction on bike safety, proper use of equipment, and basic bike handling.

Dehydration is classified as mild, moderate, or severe based on how much of the body's fluid is lost or not replenished. Stay hydrated. Our bodies are comprised of 70% fluid and without maintaining regular water intake, we can get into serious trouble. Our bodies need more than the normal 8 cups of water a day when it\u2019s hot outside. Increase water intake even more if you are working, exercising or playing when it\u2019s hot out. When severe, dehydration can lead to a life-threatening emergency also known as heat stroke.\n\nHeat emergencies fall into three categories of increasing severity: heat cramps, heat exhaustion, and heatstroke, a life-threatening condition.\n\nHeat illnesses are easily preventable by taking precautions in hot weather.\n\nChildren, elderly, and obese people have a higher risk of developing heat illness. People taking certain medications or drinking alcohol also have a higher risk. However, even a top athlete in superb condition can succumb to heat illness if he or she ignores the warning signs.\n\nIf the problem isn't addressed, heat cramps (caused by loss of salt from heavy sweating) can lead to heat exhaustion (caused by dehydration), which can progress to heatstroke. Heatstroke, the most serious of the three, can cause shock, brain damage, organ failure, and even death. Heat stroke can be a life-threatening condition. Source: http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmedhealth\/PMH0001977\/\n\nSKIN PROTECTION\n\nToo much sun can hurt! Protect the skin from the direct sun by wearing large brim hats, long sleeve\/ long pants - lightweight clothing and use sunscreen. Another great option is to seek shade under a tree in one of our many great parks.\n\nFOOD POISONING PREVENTION:\n\nKeep hot foods hot and cold foods cold. When hot foods cool & cold foods get lukewarm, bacteria thrive. This is especially challenging in the heat of summer as food tend to migrate towards the DANGER zone where bacteria can grow very quickly in the exposed food, especially foods with mayonnaise, milk, eggs and meat.\n\nStay Cool in a PP&R Pool!\n\nEnjoy outdoor fun under the watchful eyes of Portland Parks & Recreation (PP&R) lifeguards, certified by the prestigious Jeff Ellis & Associates. Portland Parks & Recreation pools offer top-of-the-line swimming instruction, water safety tips, plus open swims, water slides, play structures, special events such as Dive-In Movies (watch the screen while floating in the water!), plus other family fun and fitness opportunities.\n\nPP&R Aquatics programs take pride in providing safety to children, adults and seniors with swim lessons and instruction.\n\nPortland Parks & Recreation lifeguards are certified each year and tested continuously through the noted Jeff Ellis & Associates firm. Testing is uniform at each of our pools.\n\nPortland Parks & Recreation lifeguards undergo a rigorous and thorough Ellis & Associates certification process. Lifeguards are subject to unannounced drills, unscheduled testing, and continuous monitoring. The success of Portland Parks & Recreation lifeguards in these areas, in addition to their continued diligence to providing safe swimming pools, earned them the prestigious 2011 Jeff Ellis & Associates Silver Medal Award.\n\nPortland Parks & Recreation Aquatics offers swimming at six indoor pools (and seven outdoor, during the summer) across the city!\n\n\nPortland Parks & Recreation Outdoor Pools\n\nCreston Pool\nSE 44th Ave & Powell Blvd\n503-823-3672\n\nGrant Pool\nNE 33rd Ave& US Grant Pl\n503-823-3674\n\nMontavilla Community Center & Pool\n8219 NE Glisan St\n503-823-4101\n\nPeninsula Park Community Center & Pool\n700 N Rosa Parks Way\n503-823-3620\n\nPier Pool\nN Seneca St & St Johns Ave\n503-823-3678\n\nSellwood Pool\n7951 SE 7th Ave\n503-823-3679\n\nWilson Pool\n1151 SW Vermont St\n503-823-3680\n\n\nPortland Parks & Recreation Indoor Pools:\nCall for hours and more info\n\nBuckman Pool\n320 SE 16th Ave.\n(503) 823-3668\n\nColumbia Pool\n7701 N Chautauqua Blvd.\n(503) 823-3669\n\nEast Portland Community Center Pool\n740 SE 106th Ave.\n(503) 823-3450\n\nMatt Dishman Community Center Pool\n77 NE Knott St.\n(503) 823-3673\n\nMt.

Let me tell you, words cannot begin to describe the time these young people put in to ensure that their skills are the best they can be.       Within the past month, nearly 500 PP&R lifeguards were tested in CPR with oxygen administration and AED use, First Aid, Unconscious Guest Rescues, Spinal Immobilization, and Basic Rescues.  All lifeguards must pass this rigorous testing prior to lifeguarding in the summer.  A similar set of testing takes place in the fall for year-round lifeguards.  Lifeguards also must attend 4 hours of in-service training each month, where various skills are practiced and reviewed to keep lifeguards' skills top-notch!  During the summer, these in-services are held weekly (usually in the mornings) at the lifeguards' assigned pool.  If you are ever walking through the park or swimming in the pool during lifeguard training, you might stop for a minute to observe them practicing!      Although Portland Parks & Recreation lifeguards are very well trained, it is important to remember that \"Safety is a Team Effort\".  It is important to always keep an eye on your children in the pool.  In fact, it is PP&R Aquatics policy that \"non-swimmers and children under 48\" must be within arms reach of a swimming adult or guardian 18 years & older\".  This is just one more way that parents and lifeguards can work together to keep children safe in and around our pools.     According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), drowning is a leading cause of accidental death for young children ages 1-4, and the fifth leading reason for accidental death for people of all ages.   Portland Parks & Recreation Aquatics prides itself on providing safety to children, adults and seniors with swim lessons and instruction.   PP&R pools offer top-of-the-line swimming instruction, water safety tips, plus open swims, water slides, play structures, special events such as   Dive-In Movies (watch the screen while floating in the water!) and other family fun.

Rosa Parks Way, east gym.\r\n\r\nNOTES:  PP&R will honor Coach Roy Pittman\u2019s decades of efforts on behalf of Portland\u2019s youth.  Meet Coach and the wrestlers of Peninsula Wrestling Club, enjoy refreshments, and learn more about the legendary program\u2019s history and ways to become involved.\r\n\r\nFocused more on the process of growth and risk-taking than on winning, Pittman has worked with over 60,000 young men and women.  Many of them have won state, regional and national titles.  Peninsula Wrestling Club alumna and Milwaukie High School graduate Kelsey Campbell took part in the 2012 London Olympics women\u2019s freestyle wrestling competition.\r\n\r\nCoach Roy Pittman, high school state champion, collegiate wrestling champion, Olympian, coach, mentor, motivator, inspirational speaker and dedicated community advocate, worked for Portland Parks & Recreation for more than 30 years.  In 1970 he founded the Peninsula Wrestling Club, and helped place Portland and PP&R on the national radar.  Coach Pittman retired in 2000, but stayed active with the Peninsula Wrestling Club, continuing nearly half a century of work.\r\n\r\nIt is fitting that he will be honored this week as part of the Peninsula Centennial Celebration & Black History Month. \r\n\r\nCoach Pittman continues to rent out space from Portland Parks & Recreation to run the wrestling program.\r\n\r\n\u201cCoach is an inspiration to all with his tireless dedication to youth and their families,\u201d says Debbie Harris, PP&R recreation coordinator.  \u201cHe has served Portland for five decades through his unwavering inspiration to the sport of wrestling; he reaches out to all, and has made his spectacular wrestling program a nationally recognized model of excellence.\u201d\r\n\r\nCoach Pittman is lauded for his unwavering dedication to help youths overcome any financial, transportation or other challenges and make sure that anyone who is interested can participate in his programs.\r\n\r\nThe East Gym at Peninsula Park Community Center was dedicated and named for Coach Pittman in August of 2007.\r\n\r\nPittman has held wrestling practices for youth at Peninsula Park Community Center five days a week year around. His wrestlers compete in out-of-state tournaments, and he holds an annual wrestling summer camp.\r\n\r\n\u201cLike\u201d Peninsula Park Community Center on Facebook to keep up with the most current information on our Centennial activities. We\u2019ll post event information, historic photos, articles, details on upcoming activities, and more.

The extra traffic affects travel time and increases the potential for problems on the road affecting all travelers.\n\nA few game day changes for the Corvallis area include:\n\n* The signal timing on Highway 34 has been adjusted to allow more traffic to pass through intersections.\n* After an OSU game, motorists at the South Bypass will be restricted from turning west into town but will enjoy a fulltime green light for turning east onto Highway 34.\n* Motorists on the Van Buren Bridge traveling east on Highway 34 will not have to stop at the intersection.\n\nIn Eugene, the Pioneer Parkway exit ramp from eastbound Highway 126 (Officer Chris Kilcullen Memorial Highway) will be closed for approximately 90 minutes after an Oregon game. Motorists traveling eastbound on Highway 126 are encouraged to take the Mohawk Boulevard exit and use Q Street to access north Springfield area.\n\nOSP and ODOT also offer these simple safety tips and reminders:\n\n* Start putting together your traveling game plan now before the season starts\n* On game day: leave early, be patient and alert so you can react to sudden stops in traffic, quick lane changes by other vehicles, and leave plenty of distance between you and others on the road\n* Keep current on road and travel conditions by visiting TripCheck.com, calling 5-1-1, and listening for radio traffic-related news and updates\n* Avoid distractions and don't talk or text on cell phones when driving\n* Buckle up every trip, every time\n* Have a sober, rested driver behind the wheel of your vehicle before and after the game\n\nState, county and city police along with ODOT encourage reporting any possible intoxicated or dangerous drivers by calling 9-1-1 or OSP dispatch at 800-24DRUNK (800-243-7865).\n\n***\n\n(NOTE: You can now also follow Oregon State Police on Twitter @ORStatePolice.

It is a necessary part of the North Portland Greenway Trail project, which is an ongoing endeavor, part of a larger vision: a 10.4 mile trail to connect PP&R\u2019s Kelley Point Park to the Eastbank Esplanade.  Another plus is that it will also benefit people and dogs in St Johns with an easy way to get to Chimney Park\u2019s dog off-leash area.\n\nPlanning this project meant that we have had to balance a lot of desires, regulations, the way the topography\/land is laid out\u2026the bridge has to go over railroad tracks, for one, so it has to clear train height and there are railroad height requirements in that regards, plus bicycle safety standards, ADA access regulations, etc.\n\nThe plan as it stands has the least impact to trees while accommodating all other requirements.  \n\n That means if we didn\u2019t pursue the current plan, we would have had to consider an option that required removing A CLUSTER of trees, instead of just one.\n\nIf there was way of doing the project that didn\u2019t involve removing this tree, we would have certainly pursued it.\n\nBut the tree will continue to contribute to the well-being of Portlanders!  It will be repurposed to become PP&R\u2019s first Nature Play area at Westmoreland Park.  It will help kids connect with nature, and provide a sustainable, natural playground in the first such endeavor across our system.\n \nFurther, we will mitigate the loss of the sequoia by planting seven giant sequoias in neighboring Chimney Park, where there are much fewer trees, plus four Douglas firs, four Western Red Cedars in Chimney Park, and about TWO DOZEN OTHER TREES!   \n\nWe have worked with our Friends groups and neighbors about this project; there was an open house in December 2011 where plans were presented, we\u2019ve had very consistent messaging about the project and the fact that we planned to install the bridge at the place where there is the least impact to all trees.\n\nWhy do it now? \nWe must remove the tree before March 1 to avoid issues with migratory birds \u2013 per the Migratory Bird Act; before birds start nesting or the project would have to wait until after nesting season.\n\nThe city has 1.4 million trees total -- 1.2 million in parks and 240,000 on city streets. In 2004, the City set a goal of 33 percent of Portland's surface area covered in urban forest; currently it's at 30 percent, meaning our tree cover has INCREASED 2.6% during the past nine years. \n\nThank you for the chance to provide this information, and for caring about our parks and trees."},{"code": "Public Announcement", "post": "Timeline Photos Yay for volunteers and PP&R staff planting new, hardy, disease-resistant roses at Peninsula Park Rose Garden!

A recent news article cited figures that there is a 10 percent increase over the last year in people needing emergency food boxes.  Often, hunger is an invisible problem, but it takes its toll on our community.  \n\nFortunately, there is something we can all do to help.  \n\nStarting this week, the Portland Police Bureau\u2019s Sunshine Division will be placing barrels in City buildings as part of a month-long food drive throughout October. Barrels will be located in the Portland Building, City Hall, Police facilities and the 1900 Building. All non-perishable items are appreciated, but the Sunshine Division is especially in need of cereal.  This can be hot cereal such as Oatmeal or boxes of cold cereal.  Cereal is often not donated, and the Sunshine Division is struggling with providing breakfast options for families.\n\nThough known for their holiday food drives and food box delivery, Sunshine is actually a 24-hour-a day, year-round food and clothing relief agency. For almost 90 years, they have helped thousands of families each year.  Monday through Saturday people in need come through the doors at the Sunshine Warehouse and can take part in choosing the groceries they or their family needs.  In addition, as partners with the Portland Police Bureau, first responders also give food to people in crisis.\n \n\nTo learn more about the Sunshine Division, visit sunshinedivision.org or like them on Facebook at \nhttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/sunshinedivision?fref=ts The Portland Police Bureau Sunshine Division was started by Captain H. A. Circle in 1923.

Volunteers will plant trees, mend fences and spread new paw-friendly cedar chips. Additional amenities to the park include: a new water line for drinking fountains, double entry gates, a trash bin and two picnic benches.\n\nTrail Blazers radio broadcaster Brian Wheeler will lead a ribbon-cutting ceremony beginning at 11 a.m. commemorating the renovation of the park. The new-and-improved dog park will reopen following the ceremony when community members are invited to come out and join the celebration with their pets! \n\nDuring the celebration, Banfield associates will provide information regarding their veterinary services and hand out pet related giveaways. Dr. Ari Zabell, director of client advocate support for Banfield will also be on-hand to provide dog park etiquette and nutrition tips to attendees. Other Trail Blazers personalities, including Blaze the Trail Cat and BlazerDancers, will join Banfield and PP&R associates for the celebration. Portland Parks & Recreation Assistant Director, Warren Jimenez, will celebrate with his dogs, Rex and Whiskey. There will also be cupcakes, raffle prizes, dog treats and a professional pet photo booth to celebrate the reopening until noon. \n\nAs part of a partnership with the team, Banfield created an annual dog park renovation program. Now in its second year, Trail Blazers fans voted again for one of three PP&R dog parks to receive a makeover courtesy of Banfield and the Trail Blazers. Chimney Park won with a resounding 74% of the votes (6,176 votes). \n\nLocated in North Portland, the 5.5-acre Chimney Park was one of the first dog parks in Portland. As the city's largest fenced-in dog park, PP&R believes both two and four-legged visitors will greatly benefit from the renovations.

Kids, teens, and adults are free to check email, the internet, and to look for work on any of the 25 available computers.  \n\n\nPortland Parks & Recreation (PP&R) opens the lab (established in 1997) to all, daily. The CJCC computer lab is used for programs to help at-risk youth, and offers summer camps and homework clubs for youth and teens. The City also uses the lab for different learning events and seminars.\n\nPP&R is now consulting with Free Geek on offering free computer lessons at CJCC this fall. Free Geek\u2019s generosity not only more than doubled the size of the lab, but also provided new monitors and dozens of cables and accessories. Free Geek is also helping with any needed part replacement.\n\n\u201cFree Geek has been instrumental to our repair and upgrade strategy because their services are totally free,\u201d says CJCC lab director Richard Wade. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge benefit for Charles Jordan Community Center and North Portland.

Nor did they realize they were about to be put to the test in an emergency rescue simulation. It didn't matter. They were ready. And that's the point. The lifeguards are always ready at Portland Parks & Recreation\u2019s swim pools. PP&R Aquatics announced today that PP&R guards received a rating of \u201cExceeds Standards\u201d during a recent unannounced hidden camera audit performed by international aquatic safety expert Ellis & Associates, Inc. \r\n\r\n\u201cWe're really proud of our lifeguards, but not surprised by the results,\u201d said Nancy Roth, PP&R Aquatic Program Supervisor. \u201cWe demand excellence from our staff every day. These external audits of our operation are at the core of our commitment to safety.\u201d  \r\n\r\nLifeguards at Portland\u2019s 13 public swim pools undergo multiple unannounced audits during the course of the summer. The audits are a mandatory component of Ellis & Associate's Comprehensive Aquatic Risk Management Program (CARMP). In order to evaluate each lifeguard's professional diligence, the audits include undercover video surveillance of individual lifeguards while they protect their Zone of Protection\u00ae area. Once the video surveillance is completed, an Ellis & Associates auditor tests the basic life support and rescue skills of the staff through simulated emergencies intended to measure the effectiveness of a facility's emergency action plan. \r\n\r\nThe audit concludes with administrative, supervisory, and facility evaluations. \u201cEarning this rating is a remarkable accomplishment,\u201d said Richard A. Carroll, Ellis & Associates Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. \u201cThese lifeguards are on the top of their game. The guests at PP&R facilities are getting the highest degree of swimmer protection available in the aquatic industry.\u201d\r\n\r\nAbout Jeff Ellis & Associates, Inc.\r\nFounded in 1983, Jeff Ellis & Associates, Inc.

The north Portland playground is the first in Portland\u2019s park system to provide disabled access on every play feature.\n\nThe play area is the result of a remarkable public-private partnership between PP&R and the Goldberg family. It will be named Harper\u2019s Playground after Harper Goldberg, who turns seven on the day of the event, and whose family spearheaded the extraordinary fundraising efforts for the playground.\n\nConstruction is expected to take about 2\u00bd months. Portland Parks & Recreation views Harper\u2019s Playground as a neighborhood destination and gathering space for all.  \n\nWHAT: Groundbreaking and Celebration for Harper\u2019s Playground\nWHEN: Friday, June 8, 10am\nWHERE: Harper\u2019s Playground at Arbor Lodge Park, N. Bryant & Delaware Ave \n\nHarper\u2019s Playground will have all-inclusive play structures, featuring wheelchair- and walker-friendly elements integrated into play equipment. It will be the first 100% accessible play area in PP&R\u2019s system. (Washington Park\u2019s impressive playground is 70% accessible.)\n\n\u201cJust two years ago, dedicated parents Cody and April Goldberg envisioned a playground where their child, Harper, could play alongside other neighborhood kids,\u201d says Portland Parks Commissioner Nick Fish. \u201cThey\u2019ve shared their compelling vision, generated incredible community support, and have developed an innovative park design concept that will serve as a model for park improvements across the country.\u201d \n\nPP&R is able to undertake construction on the project thanks to the funds that the Goldberg family and valued partners were able to raise.\n \nNotables at the groundbreaking include\n\u2022 Glen & Tiffany Boyd speaking on behalf of foundation contributions\n\u2022 Bob Speltz, representing the Portland business sector\n\u2022 Rabbi Ariel Stone for communities of faith\n\u2022 Taylor Brooke representing volunteers & University of Portland women's soccer\n\u2022 Felicia Chapman of the Harper's Playground Board and Timbers Army\n\u2022 Dean Westwood, Inclusion & Universal Design Advocate\n\u2022 Mauricio Villarreal, Project Team \/ Design & Project Management\n\u2022 City Parks Commissioner Nick Fish representing Portland Parks & Recreation and the City of Portland\n\u2022 Jennifer Yocom, Chief of Staff to Mayor Sam Adams\n\nThe Goldbergs say they have been delighted by the support they have received from Portland Parks & Recreation and the community for their efforts.\n\n\u201cWow! We can\u2019t believe we are so close to seeing our vision come into being, says Cody Goldberg. \u201cWe are humbled that so many people have invested so much of themselves to help make this a reality.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would like to thank, in particular, our talented and equally passionate project team \u2013 MIG & Girvin Associates for the incredible concept plan and renderings; Atelier Dreiseitl + PLACE for the hours and hours on the construction documents and sundry project supports; and Gerding Edlen Development and Walsh Construction for outstanding project management support.\u201d \n\nHistory of Harper\u2019s Playground\nThe Goldberg family lives near Arbor Lodge Park, and had noticed that their daughter had difficulty using the existing play structure there.\n\nThey began raising funds through events such as bake and rummage sales, and neighborhood kids\u2019 concerts. But the efforts soon ballooned to include notable partners and businesses committed to making this public-private partnership a reality.\n\nThe famous Timbers Army, ardent supporters of their team and community, sold a limited edition Harper\u2019s Playground scarf through the Timbers\u2019 2011 season. The Army has raised nearly $65,000 for Harper\u2019s Playground.\n\nWhen Cody Goldberg spoke at a marketing class at the University of Portland last fall, he inspired Emma Nelson, a senior defender on the powerhouse women\u2019s soccer team. She invited her Pilot teammates to get involved with Harper\u2019s Playground. The result: the Pilots held a season-long fundraiser that raised $5,000 for Harper\u2019s Playground. The team has decided to adopt the cause again this coming season, and co-captain Taylor Brooke is currently working as an intern for Harper\u2019s Playground for the summer.\n\nSome motivated volunteers helped the Goldbergs put on an auction gala in April of 2011 that raised $54,000.\n\nHarper\u2019s Playground got a vital boost when the W. Glen Boyd Charitable Foundation contributed $75,000 to the cause.  \n\nAbout Harper\nHarper Rose Kligman Goldberg is the daughter of Cody and April Goldberg, who live in north Portland\u2019s Arbor Lodge neighborhood. Harper will celebrate her seventh birthday on the day of her namesake playground celebration.  \n\nDoctors expected that Harper, who has a developmental disability, would never walk nor talk. However, Harper defied medical expectation by taking her first independent steps at the age of five. Though she still uses a walker much of the time, Harper loves to enjoy playgrounds, and now has the city\u2019s newest one named in her honor."},{"code": "Public Announcement", "post": "Not sure if it's true, but better safe than sorry....and PP&R DOES ask that you NOT feed the wild ducks and geese!"},{"code": "Public Announcement", "post": "Ok, rain, the grass in Portland Parks & Recreation parks is green enough.

According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), in 2010, 41 percent of all highway fatalities across the nation on Halloween night (6:00 p.m., October 29, to 5:59 a.m., November 1) involved a driver or motorcycle rider with a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of .08 or higher.\r\n\r\nODOT's Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) reported no traffic fatalities in Oregon during Halloween night over the last three years. FARS statistics between 1998 and 2008 tell a scarier story as 90 percent of the fatalities (10) on Halloween night in Oregon occurred in alcohol and\/or drug-involved traffic crashes.\r\n\r\nDuring the last two Halloween nights, on Sunday and Monday respectively, OSP troopers arrested 8 DUII drivers each night. The numbers tell a different story when Halloween fell on a Saturday night in 2009; troopers then arrested 34 DUII drivers, which is why law enforcement agencies are concerned about this weekend when many Halloween parties may happen.\r\n\r\n\"Plan now if you are attending a weekend Halloween event and have an alert, sober driver operating any vehicle,\" said Phillips.\r\n\r\nODOT, OSP and local law enforcement agencies offer these simple reminders for a safer Halloween:   \r\n\r\nFor all drivers: \r\n*Slow down in residential neighborhoods and obey all traffic signs and signals. \r\n*Slow down on streets where there are no sidewalks and children are walking on or near street and shoulder of the road. \r\n*Enter and exit driveways and alleys slowly and cautiously. Have child passengers enter and exit cars on the curb side, away from traffic. \r\n\r\nFor adult traffic safety: \r\n*Be responsible - never drive impaired. \r\n*If you plan to drink, choose your sober driver before going out. \r\n*Be aware of weather and traffic conditions before you leave, adjusting your speed and driving to the conditions. \r\n*If impaired, use mass transit, call a cab or ask a sober friend to get you home. \r\n*If all else fails, just stay where you are and sleep it off. \r\n*Always buckle up - it's still your best defense against an impaired driver. \r\n*If hosting a Halloween party, make sure all guests leave with a sober driver. \r\n\r\nFor parents and children: \r\n*Dress children in bright costumes. Use reflective tape or stickers on dark costumes. \r\n*Apply face paint or cosmetics appropriate for children directly to the face. It is safer than a loose-fitting mask that can obstruct a child's vision. \r\n*If a mask is worn, cut the eyeholes large enough for full vision. \r\n*Have children carry flashlights or glow sticks to improve their visibility. \r\n*Secure hats so they will not slip over children's eyes. \r\n*Remind children to cross streets only at intersections. \r\n*Teach them to stop and look for cars, looking to the left, right and left again before crossing, and then to keep looking both ways for cars while they cross. \r\n*Teach them never to dart into a street or cross a street from between parked cars. \r\n\r\nElementary age pedestrians are at highest risk because they: \r\n*Have a field of vision one-third narrower than an adult's. \r\n*Are unable to determine the direction of sounds. \r\n*Cannot accurately judge the speed or distance of moving vehicles. \r\n*Overestimate their abilities. \r\n*Are easily hidden by parked cars, bushes, leaf piles, trash bins, etc. \r\n  \r\nEveryone plays an important role in keeping our roads and children safe. Immediately report aggressive, dangerous and intoxicated drivers to 9-1-1 or the Oregon State Police at 1-800-24DRUNK (1-800-243-7865).\r\n\r\nQuestions about local efforts should be directed to your local city, county and State Police offices.\r\n\r\nImage - National Highway Traffic Safety Administration"},{"code": "Public Safety", "post": "Robbery and then a shooting occur at 82nd and Sandy http:\/\/bit.ly\/Syg6f5"},{"code": "Public Safety", "post": "Bank robbed in downtown Portland http:\/\/bit.ly\/RFvAO2"},{"code": "Public Safety", "post": "Man armed with an AK-47 Assault rifle threatens construction workers in the Walnut Park Neighborhood http:\/\/bit.ly\/UE6QdM"},{"code": "Public Safety", "post": "Man drives his car into Terry Schrunk Plaza http:\/\/bit.ly\/UDy5F8"},{"code": "Public Safety", "post": "Missing Portland Man Found Deceased in the Sellwood-Moreland Neighborhood http:\/\/bit.ly\/XRH1FK"},{"code": "Public Safety", "post": "A man is stabbed in the Madison neighborhood http:\/\/bit.ly\/XIlHCF"},{"code": "Public Safety", "post": "Medically fragile woman is missing from the Arbor Lodge neighborhood http:\/\/bit.ly\/XEmJiX"},{"code": "Public Safety", "post": "Portland Police investigate a shooting in the Lents neighborhood http:\/\/bit.ly\/WPpuyA"},{"code": "Public Safety", "post": "Portland Police Investigating a Bank Robbery in Northeast Portland's Sullivan's Gulch Neighborhood http:\/\/bit.ly\/Vl91UN"},{"code": "Public Safety", "post": "Portland Police Investigating an Overnight Armed Robbery in Northeast Portland's Irvington Neighborhood http:\/\/bit.ly\/RagUpY"},{"code": "Public Safety", "post": "Domestic Violence Offender Sweep Nets 11 Arrests http:\/\/bit.ly\/Qy933X"},{"code": "Public Safety", "post": "Portland Police Seek Suspect Who Punched TriMet Operator in the Head in North Portland's Portsmouth Neighborhood http:\/\/bit.ly\/U7e6yx"},{"code": "Public Safety", "post": "Portland Police assist Animal Control in capturing a Boa Constrictor in NE Portland.

Bob was handing out maps and answering questions from tourists. I asked him about his job, found it was a volunteer position, and that I could apply. I did so and was soon the proud owner of a yellow \u201cPark Host\u201d vest, a batch of literature about the park, and a bundle of maps to hand out.\r\n\r\nBecause the Rose Garden area was nicely covered with volunteers, I chose to walk the trails in Washington Park and the Hoyt Arboretum. There I found many tourists in need of a map and directions. They had questions about the park, wanted to see a particular tree or feature, or were just seeking advice on where to hike. My first day I encountered a couple who was lost. The map did not overcome their despair, so I walked them back to their car. \r\n\r\nI live near the park and frequently hike the trails year-long. People are usually friendly, but with the yellow vest and the handful of free maps, people become unusually engaging and talkative. I\u2019ve had the pleasure of meeting individuals from all over the country and the world as they enjoy the beauty of Portland\u2019s parks. Occasionally, I remind people that their dogs should be leashed, but I\u2019ve never had a bad experience from anyone.\r\n\r\nBeing a park host volunteer is perfect for me. I enjoy talking to people. I like to be outside on the trails. The times and duration are entirely up to me, although it makes sense to volunteer on sunny, weekend days when the need is the greatest! The pay is not good (it\u2019s a volunteer effort!) but the experience is priceless!\r\n\r\n-Tom Carter (Park Host Volunteer)"},{"code": "Call to Action", "post": "PP&R Ladybug Walks for Preschoolers!

We spoke of the disciplinary process for employees in general and the specific movement of Lt. Todd Wyatt to the Detective Division. The movement of Lt. Wyatt to the Detective Division was not a disciplinary decision. This move was a management decision in order to place Lt. Wyatt under the direct supervision of Commander Donna Henderson.\n\n \u201cI informed the Editorial Board that Commander Henderson has a Master\u2019s degree in counseling and has successfully mentored other employees. This fact, which was an extremely relevant factor in Lt. Wyatt\u2019s movement, was not in the printed edition of the article, and the fact the Commander Henderson has successfully mentored other employees was also omitted in both print and on-line versions of the article.\n\n \u201cIn the discipline decision making process, the final decision needs to be consistent, within the range of past discipline imposed, as well as defendable in the arbitration process. It was in this context that I felt the demotion of Lt. Wyatt was appropriate. For this reason I feel the title of the article is incorrect and taken out of context. I did not defend my decision to demote Lt. Wyatt; I merely explained the discipline process to where a demotion was the correct level of discipline given the factors mentioned above.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Chief Mike Reese"},{"code": "Selfie", "post": "Real Cops The reality show that never happened..."},{"code": "Selfie", "post": "New Hires A photo from the DPSST Basic Academy Class 333 Graduation.

Duke On December 4, 1946, Officer Charles H. Duke became the second African-American officer to join the Portland Police Bureau, the first in the 20th Century. The first, George Hardin, served from 1894 to 1915.\n\nAt the time of his appointment, Officer Duke scored first out of the 203 individuals taking the entrance exam. In his original application, he wrote that he wanted to become a police officer, \u201cbecause I believe that I can do my community some good in this capacity.\u201d\n\nOfficer Duke remained with the Police Bureau until March 5, 1951, when he returned to the military where he had served with the Army Air Corps in World War II and was one of the famed \u201cTuskegee Airmen.\u201d He became a pilot in the Air Force, eventually retiring as a Captain. On June 22, 2005, 89-year-old Duke died in Carencro, Louisiana.\n\nIt is chronicled in the Portland Police Museum that Officer Duke\u2019s appointment and his first years were not easy. While he eventually received some level of acceptance in the organization, he was never given opportunities available to his peers. Despite this, he stayed for several years and opened the door to other minority officers, including his two brothers, George and Horace.\n\n\u201cOne of the criteria for the Achievement Award is that the nominee is an outstanding role model or mentor for others within the criminal justice profession,\u201d said Chief Derrick Foxworth in 2005. \u201cI never met Officer Duke, but admire what he did and his willingness to be the first. I believe Officer Duke achieved the stated goal in his original application and performed an invaluable service to this and many other law enforcement organizations by becoming, and for several years remaining, a Portland Police Officer.\u201d \n\nOn Monday, August 15, 2005, Chief Derrick Foxworth posthumously honored former Portland Police Officer Charles Duke with the Bureau\u2019s Achievement Medal in August 2005.

We wanted to share it here and urge people to read the Auditor's report:\n\nI am asking for a retraction in regard to the Oregonian article that appeared in the October 3, 2012 print edition, \"Chief Questions Staff Integrity.\" This article, written by Maxine Bernstein, was intentionally inflammatory and misconstrued what is actually in the Auditor's report.\n\nThe first issue I have is that the headline itself did not match the story. There is nothing in the story that that discusses the headline's claim.\n\nThe article also mischaracterizes the statements by Lieutenant Robert King, where Maxine says \"he was forced to admit he had written five drafts...\" Lt. King freely admitted he wrote multiple drafts and supplied those drafts throughout the various processes. He was not forced to do anything. In addition, Maxine has repeatedly pointed out that Lt. King broke down into tears. Maxine was not in the arbitration hearings when Lt. King testified and her description of Lt. King's emotional response is not reflected in the transcripts. In fact, Lt. King never broke down under cross examination by the PPA's attorney. Finally, she goes on to cite the union's claim that Lt. King shut out the opinion of lead police trainers, but fails to balance it with the Auditor's assertion that trainers confirmed they had several conversations with Lt. King about what was being taught in training as it relates to the Campbell case.\n\nThe Auditor's report said the following: King testified consistently in response to questions on direct and cross-examination; his testimony did not materially change, he did not omit material information, he did not contradict himself and he did not retract any of his own testimony.\" This did not appear in any of Maxine's article. Instead she quotes an officer who the Auditor points out should not be considered because he was assigned to the Training Division shortly before the Training Analysis was finalized and King never testified he even consulted with that officer.\n\nFinally, the articles in the Oregonian regarding the Auditor's report are not a factual account of what that report contained, but seem to be more intent on publishing salacious material unrelated to what was actually in the report.\n\nI urge the Oregonian to print a retraction.\n\nMike ReeseSee More\nhttp:\/\/www.portlandonline.com\/auditor\/index.cfm?c=44653&a=413285\nwww.portlandonline.com"},{"code": "Selfie", "post": "Timeline Photos Portland Police Bureau (Portland, Oregon) shared Portland Police Bureau Recruiting's photo."},{"code": "Selfie", "post": "The future of the Portland Police Bureau: Chief Mike Reese By Michael Reese, Contributing Columnist Recently, Portland police officers responded to a call regarding a distraught man who told onlookers near the RiverPlace Marina he was going to commit suici...

She's so EXCITED and INSPIRED to learn, be a big girl, have playdates with her new friends - She blossomed on her first day! And to think, Teacher Derek called me twice to let me know she was fine.

The American Planning Association has designated Portland's Waterfront Park as one of America's 10 Great Public Spaces for 2012."},{"code": "Selfie", "post": "Portland Parks & Recreation's Tom McCall Waterfront Park Designated as American Planning Association \r\n2012 Top 10 Great Public Space!\r\n\r\nPark Noted for Design, Amenities, History and Usage \r\n\r\n(Portland, OR) \u2013\r\nThe American Planning Association (APA) today announced the designation of Portland Parks & Recreation (PP&R)\u2019s Governor Tom McCall Waterfront Park as one of 10 Great Public Spaces for 2012 under the organization\u2019s Great Places in America program. APA Great Places exemplify exceptional character and highlight the role planning and planners play in adding value to communities, including fostering economic growth and creating jobs.\r\n\r\nAPA singled out Gov. Tom McCall Waterfront Park, commonly known as Waterfront Park, for its design and features, history, and high level of community support and use. This 30-acre park along the west bank of the Willamette River is an integral part of Portland\u2019s downtown and the city\u2019s cultural, recreational and social life. Pioneer Courthouse Square and Ladd\u2019s Addition are also honored as Great Places in Portland.  \r\n\u201cWaterfront Park is part of the fabric of the Rose City,\u201d says Portland Mayor Sam Adams. \u201cInstead of the freeway that used to run through the space, we have a lush, green gathering place for all, one we are happy to call a Great Public Space.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe are delighted by the designation of Gov. Tom McCall Waterfront Park as a Great Public Space,\u201d adds Portland Parks Commissioner Nick Fish.  \u201cIt is a worthy honor for a park that allows Portlanders and visitors from around the world to embrace the Willamette River as a vital part of the high quality of life we enjoy in Portland.\u201d\r\n\r\n Through Great Places in America, APA recognizes streets, neighborhoods and public spaces whose unique and authentic characteristics have evolved from thoughtful and deliberate planning by residents, community leaders, and planners. The 2012 Great Places, which offer more choices for where and how people work and live, have many of the features Americans say are important to their \u201cideal community\u201d including close, locally owned businesses; transit; neighborhood parks; and sidewalks.\r\n\"Waterfront Park is a classic Portland story and the perfect homage to Governor Tom McCall,\u201d says Bureau of Planning and Sustainability Director Susan Anderson.  \u201cThanks to the vision of past community leaders, we now have a precious place along the river, a showcase park where families bring their children to play in the fountains; craft and food markets abound; cyclists, runners and walkers can cruise the promenade; and a robust series of summer concerts and events have found a place to call home.\u201d \r\nSince APA began Great Places in America in 2007, 60 neighborhoods, 60 streets and 50 public spaces have been designated in 50 states and the District of Columbia.\r\n\r\n\u201cWaterfront Park is the result of planning initiatives that gave a voice to residents and life to their ideas,\u201d said APA Chief Executive Officer Paul Farmer, FAICP. \u201cCitizen Engagement through planning \u2013 something 75 percent of Americans agree is essential to improving people\u2019s lives \u2013 has been crucial to the park\u2019s success. \r\nIt was the call of residents \u2013 to demolish a freeway and create a park \u2013 that reverberated through the halls of government in Portland and Salem, provoking action,\u201d he added. \r\n\r\nThe need for a Portland greenway along the riverbanks and to preserve river access for future generations was first identified in a 1903 Olmsted Brothers report. These sentiments were reiterated nine years later in the Bennett Plan.\r\n\r\nOccasional winter flooding prevented the riverfront land from being fully utilized. A seawall, built in 1929 to protect the downtown, limited access to the river, an issue that was exacerbated when Harbor Drive opened along the bank of the river in 1943.\r\n\r\nIn 1968, the state proposed widening Harbor Drive. At the same time, Portland\u2019s Downtown Waterfront Plan recommended burying Harbor Drive and developing the land as a park. Formation of Riverfront for People in 1969 to fight the expansion and a report by the Portland City Club encouraging riverfront development for public use, led Gov. Tom McCall to appoint a citizens\u2019 committee to study Harbor Drive options. \r\n\r\nAfter Harbor Drive closed in 1974, a $20 million master plan was created for a downtown waterfront park. The resulting park served as a springboard for several hundred housing units, a hotel, marina, restaurants and retail shops. A 2003 master plan update, which attracted an average of 500 people to each of its hearings, focused on improved functionality and enhanced aesthetics.  \r\n\r\nIts strategic downtown location and amenities make Tom McCall Waterfront Park one of Portland\u2019s most visited.  The park draws hundreds of daily visitors for recreation and relaxation. Thousands more flock to the many outdoor festivals held at Waterfront Park.  The park\u2019s vast lawns are currently undergoing turf restoration to improve drainage and grass.  \r\n\r\nOther features include the 1947 sternwheeler Portland that houses the Oregon Maritime Center and Museum. The Bill Naito Legacy Fountain features playful water spouts emerging from decorative pavers. The Japanese American Historical Plaza, with its garden and cherry trees, is dedicated to those who were deported to inland internment camps during World War II.  The Battleship Oregon Memorial pays tribute to the 1893 USS Oregon, the \u201cBulldog of the US Navy.\u201d\r\n\r\nTom McCall Waterfront Park is a critical component of the 40-Mile Loop, an Olmsted Brothers proposal to ring the city with interconnected greenways. The name remains although, when completed, the 40-mile Loop will actually be 140 miles long, connecting more than 30 parks.\r\n\r\nThe nine other APA 2012 Great Public Spaces are: Bienville Square, Mobile, AL; Cesar Chavez Park and Plaza, Sacramento, CA; Washington Park, Denver, CO; Chicago Botanic Garden, IL; Chicago Union Station, Chicago, IL; Jackson Square, New Orleans, LA; Village Green, Bar Harbor, ME; Buffalo Bayou, Houston, TX; and Ritter Park, Huntington, WV."},{"code": "Selfie", "post": "Portland Parks & Recreation updated their cover photo."},{"code": "Selfie", "post": "Thanks to devoted PP&R supporter Linda Robinson, PP&R staff and the Hazelwood neighborhood for smashing \"Celebrate the NEW East Holladay Park\" event this weekend!

Litzenberg, Officer James D. Wright, and Officer Gilbert H. Horton to the Oregon Fallen Law Enforcement Officer Memorial. \n\nThe nominations were made through the historic recognition process which allows for the addition of names of officers who died in the line of duty whose deaths were unknown when the memorial was created 20 years ago. It is the goal of the Board to honor and remember the sacrifices of all of Oregon's fallen officers and they families they left behind. \n\nThe Portland Police Museum identified these three officers of the Portland Police Bureau who died while in the line of duty in the 1900s. For many years these deaths went unknown until members of the Portland Police Museum discovered their stories as they conducted historical research of yearly reports sent to the mayor's office. \n\nThe names will be officially added during the 2013 Oregon Fallen Law Enforcement Officers Memorial. This event will take place at 1:00 pm on Tuesday, May 7, 2013 at the Oregon Public Safety Academy in Salem. The memorial honors more than 170 fallen Oregon law enforcement officers who have died in the line of duty since the 1880s. This includes officers from city, county, state, tribal and federal law enforcement agencies who have served as law enforcement officers, corrections officers, and parole and probation officers. \n\nThe National Law Enforcement Memorial in Washington, D.C. has also accepted the three nominations and will be including these officers on their memorial. \n\nThe deaths meet the criteria for the Oregon Law Enforcement Officer Memorial. Oregon Administrative Rule 259-008-0100 (i), which defines \"In the line of duty death\" as a fatal injury which is the direct or proximate result of any enforcement action or emergency response resulting in death or death directly resulting from law enforcement training for enforcement action or emergency response that the law enforcement officer is authorized or obligated to perform by law, rule, regulation, or condition of employment or service while on or off duty. \n\nBackground Information on Portland Police Officer Glenn L. Litzenberg, Officer James D. Wright, and Officer Gilbert H. Horton: \n\nGlenn L. Litzenberg \n1887 - 1918 \n\nGlenn moved from Iowa to Portland around 1905 when he was 18. His father had been a blacksmith and died when Glenn was seven. His mother moved with her children to join her son in Portland. \n\nGlenn worked as a clerk, laborer, longshoreman and messenger driver until he joined the Bureau in March of 1915. \n\n\"Litz\" as he was called by fellow officers, started out on foot patrol working traffic and enforcing prohibition laws in and out of uniform. In early 1917 he played center on the Police Benefit and Athletic Association ice hockey septet. He joined the brand-new motorcycle squad in the fall of 1917. \n\nOn April 20, 1918 Litzenberg was on motorcycle patrol, following about 50 yards behind his partner. He was approaching east 7th and Beech when a passenger car pulled into the blind intersection. He collided with the left front of the vehicle and was thrown into the air, falling headfirst onto the pavement and dying within minutes. \n\nLitzenberg was considered conscientious, thorough, popular, quiet and every inch an officer. His funeral was said to have been one of the largest in recent memory. \n\nHe was 31 and survived by his wife, mother and siblings. \n\nJames D. Wright \n1886 - 1923 \n\nJ.D. was born in Des Moines, Iowa. He worked on the family farm until 1910, briefly became a butcher and in 1911 he joined the Army, eventually becoming a military policeman. \n\nWhile stationed at Fort Yellowstone he met Clara Poe who was waitressing at the Yellowstone National Park. They were married and in 1918 moved to Portland. \n\nAppointed to the Bureau in the fall of 1918, he was 32 years old. He initially worked foot patrol out of Headquarters; in 1920 he was assigned to the new East sub-station in the firehouse at 35th and Belmont. Shortly afterwards, he moved to motorcycle patrol. \n\nIn 1921, 2nd and Couch was called \"the most wicked spot in Portland.\" Considered to be full of illiterate criminals, Wright was partnered with patrolman Read and both were assigned to work the area. \n\nOn January 18, 1923, Wright was sent to investigate a reported death at a Washington Street lodging house. The person had died of pneumonia. Standard procedures of the time meant that Wright had to stay in the room, search the room for information and wait for the coroner. \n\nWright went home and told his wife that he would probably die. Three days later, on January 21, Wright died at the age of 36. He was survived by his wife and four year old son. His son contracted pneumonia, brought home by J.D., but he survived and went on to serve 30 years with Portland Police. \n\nGilbert H. Horton \n1881-1946 \n\nBorn in Iowa, his family moved to Needy, Oregon in 1886 and later settled in the Oregon City area. \n\nGil attended high school in Oregon City and soon moved to Portland where he was married in 1908. The couple lived on a strawberry farm near West Linn. Later he worked as a laborer and a clerk with the Portland City Water Works Department. \n\nAppointed in 1910 at the age of 29, he worked foot patrol out of Headquarters for many years. By the 1930s he was in the traffic division, driving a patrol car. \n\nOn December 23, 1946 he was working in Union Station. That evening, he was called about a drunk on one of the train cars and found a 42 year old woman who was very inebriated, loud and disorderly. Horton placed her under arrest and with the assistance of a special officer, removed her from the train. As they walked through Union Station he collapsed, dying within minutes of a heart attack. \n\nHorton was 65 and survived by his grown daughter."},{"code": "Tragedy\/Loss", "post": "Faith sustains family of Clackamas deputy shot 10 years ago Ten years ago, on January 9th, 2003, Damon Coates, a popular and respected Clackamas County Sheriff\u2019s deputy, was shot in the face and nearly died.

Wohllaib told police that he last saw Angela on May 11, 1996 as she left their residence with an unknown male.\r\n\r\nAngela was described as a white female, 5\u20198\u201d, 115 lbs, with blonde shoulder length hair and blue eyes.  \r\n\r\nOn June 2, 1996, a recreational snorkel diver was diving in the Washougal River approx 100 feet downstream from the Dougan Falls Bridge in Skamania County, Washington. He noticed something shiny on the bottom of a pool and dove to investigate. As he dove closer he saw a hand and arm. He immediately went to the surface and called 9-1-1.\r\n\r\nThe Skamania County Sheriff\u2019s Office responded, called a dive team and determined that there was a body of a white female on the river bottom fully clothed. The body was subsequently recovered, an autopsy was performed and the cause of death was trauma, not drowning. Using dental records, this body was then identified as that of Angela Krueger.\r\n\r\nMs. Krueger was last seen alive in North Portland and her body was recovered 23 days later in the Washougal River in Skamania County, WA. Ms. Krueger had no contact with anyone after May 11, 1996, either in person or via phone or pager. This was unusual as Ms Krueger was said by her family to always respond to her pager. \r\n\r\nInvestigators believe that Ms. Krueger was likely killed on May 11. Based upon the remoteness of the location where Angela Krueger\u2019s body was found, it is also likely that Ms. Krueger\u2019s killer or killers were familiar with the area of Dougan Falls and the Washougal River.\r\n\r\nCrime Stoppers is offering a cash reward of up to $1,000 for information, reported to Crime Stoppers, that leads to an arrest in this case, or any unsolved felony, and you can remain anonymous.\r\n\r\nLeave a Crime Stoppers tip online at http:\/\/www.crimestoppersoforegon.com , text CRIMES (274637) and in the subject line put 823HELP, followed by your tip, or call 503-823-HELP (4357) and leave your tip information.\r\n \r\nVisit http:\/\/www.tipsoft.com to download the Crime Stoppers App for the iPhone or Droid."},{"code": "Public Help", "post": "Crime Stoppers Featured Case #13-01 North Portland Cat Theft The Portland Police Bureau, in cooperation with Crime Stoppers of Oregon, is asking for the public's help in identifying a person that stole a cat in North Portland's St. John's Neighborhood.On Novemb...

Helping to care for the Vietnam Veteran\u2019s Memorial has been inspiring.\u201d\n\nCity Parks Commissioner Nick Fish offers his sincere thanks to the veteran volunteers.\n\n\u201cThe work these men and women contribute is beneficial not only to veterans, but to people who live in Portland and who visit from around the world,\u201d says Fish. \u201cTheir continued courage and service is incredibly admirable.\u201d\n\nCombat veteran Tom Moore was disabled during his 1969-1970 tour of Vietnam.  Part of a 13-member Navy Construction Battalion team (the Seabees), Moore was stationed in Vietnam in support of the 101st Airborne Division and the 3rd Marines.\n\nThough he says he struggles with life challenges, Moore took part in Footsteps to Recovery\u2019s first cleanup effort in Washington Park this past spring. He says he can\u2019t wait to be back there again.\n\n\u201cBeing in service, especially in service to other veterans, is the foundation of healing and part of what has kept me going for a number of years,\u201d says Moore.\n\nHe says that volunteer efforts such as the ones at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial help him overcome the debilitating effects he has suffered. \n\n\u201cPTSD, depression, all the things that go along with combat and war,\u201d Moore lists the challenges almost casually. \u201cHighest on the list is camaraderie. When we volunteer, [it\u2019s] almost like same fellowship we had at one time, even though most of us didn\u2019t know each other until recovery. That sense of belonging, of purpose, of giving back.\u201d\n\nInterested veterans may contact the Portland VA Footsteps to Recovery program (contact info below) to sign up for the volunteer effort.\n\n\u201cOnce we\u2019re given the experience and opportunity, it all comes together,\u201d adds Vietnam veteran Moore. \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for Footsteps, I probably wouldn\u2019t be here today.\u201d\n\nFor more info on the Portland VA\u2019s Footsteps to Recovery program, contact\nLara.Gifford@va.gov or log on to http:\/\/www.portland.va.gov\/ The Portland VA Medical Center provides health care services to Veterans in Oregon and Southwest Washingtonfor the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs."},{"code": "Public Help", "post": "Timeline Photos We love our volunteers!

Today, Dick\u2019s dream continues to be realized in the area officially known as Portland Parks & Recreation\u2019s Columbia Children\u2019s Arboretum at 10040 NE 6th Ave, off NE Meadow Drive.  PP&R acquired the land in 1999 and established a master plan for the area in 2004.\r\n\r\nDick and Gyrid were instrumental in raising money for the trust fund that was set up by ECNA for work in the park (in conjunction with Multnomah County Drainage District #1.) They raised nearly $132,000 from public and private sources. These funds were used to make improvements to the drainage ditches through and around the park, and to plant native plants on the ditch banks. As a result of their efforts, two bridges were installed to provide access to the park from NE Meadow Drive and between the two sections of the arboretum. The bridges replaced culverts and were made out of recycled railroad car frames.\r\n \r\n\r\nThe Towle family invites well-wishers to donate to the Columbia Children\u2019s Arboretum in lieu of flowers.
